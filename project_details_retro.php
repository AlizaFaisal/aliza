        <h4>Development Process</h4>
        <p>To develop the entire solution for RetroRecords, I relied on the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JS. That is because the project had static content so no dynamic languages were used, HTML structured the page, styling was done using CSS3, JS was used to implement sliders to bring the look & feel of the shop into the website, towards the end different screen breakpoint were added and website was made responsive content sync with each other perfectly. At every level, I discussed with the client to ensure my development efforts produced the desired results.</p>
        <p>Even though the challenges were complex, I managed to stay focused on the end-goal. Quality was guaranteed at every iteration, which eventually led to a stable and competent solution.</p>

        <p>The client found all components of the completed solution to sync with each other perfectly.</p>
